## Authority Statements

Authority statements are the critical pieces of information stored in trust registries for the benefit of all participants in a digital trust ecosystem. As shown in Figure&nbsp;2, both ecosystem governing authorities and trust registry operators can publish authority statements. The standard structure and vocabulary of TRQP authority statements is defined in [Authority Statements and Query Vocabulary](#authority-statements-and-query-vocabulary).

### Authority Statements and Query Vocabulary
*This section is normative.*

Authority statements in TRQP are designed to communicate essential information about authorizations, delegations, recognitions, and descriptions (metadata). They share a consistent three-part structure and employ a standardized vocabulary for querying.

### Standard Structure

Interoperability across ecosystems requires shared semantics for querying authority statements. Therefore, TRQP authority statements are structured in three standard parts as shown below:

These three strings are simple yet flexible enough to express all types of authority statements, including authorization, recognition, delegation, and description (metadata), as defined in this section.
